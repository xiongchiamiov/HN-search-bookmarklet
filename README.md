This was an attempt to make a bookmarklet that will load up the Hacker News
discussion for the page I'm on, if it exists.

As [pointed out to me on Stack Overflow][0], the *same origin policy* prevents
this from working, at least directly. There are ways to get around it, but they
are far too much effort for right now, especially when I've 10 days of email to
read and response to.
